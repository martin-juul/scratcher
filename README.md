# Scratcher

Selfhosted music for all of your devices.

## What is this project aiming to solve?

Having used Plex for a long time for my video content (which it does really well). Their music implementation in my opinion leaves something to be desired.
There are many music server implementations, AirSonic is one of the better known ones. It does what it says on the tin, and does it well.
Although i think more focus on the more casual end user is what this space desperately needs.

So that's why i chose to make Scratcher.

## Components

### [server](./server/README.md)

This is the heart of the suite. It is tasked with providing all backend functionality for the clients.

### [client](./client/README.md)

Now this is where it gets more interesting. As this is where you will _hopefully_ spend most of your time.
The client is written using React Native, supporting Android, iOS, macOS and Windows.
